      # The first installation step ensures that all of our production
      # dependencies work on the given Node.js version, this helps us find
      # dependencies that don't match our engines field:
      - run: npm install --production --engine-strict --ignore-scripts --no-package-lock
      # Clean up the production install, before installing dev/production:
      - run: rm -rf node_modules
      - run: npm install
